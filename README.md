# EZ Finance
Financial Literacy Application built for TAMUHack 2023
EZ Finance helps kids, teens, and college students set and track financial goals while managing expenses. Saving made simple and fun. Get control of your money today!

## Inspiration
Seeing the detrimental effects the lack of financial literacy can have on students and siblings we grew up around, we wanted to develop an application that would help others be able to better manage and track their finances. This way they would be better equipped when making financial decisions that impact their daily lives and futures.

## What it does
EZ Finance is perfect for kids, teens, and college students who want to learn how to manage their money. It's easy to use for managing your budgets, expenses, and tracking your financial goals all in one place. Get in control of your money and start planning for your financial future! Our project is split into EZ Budget and EZ Goal applications. Using the EZ Budget, you can customize budgeting categories, manage your expenses, and see how much you have spent each month and how much you have left to spend for the month. Using EZ Goal, set a financial goal and input your income, money already saved, and desired time frame. The tool will determine how much you need to save each month to reach your goal by that date, with a visual of the percentage of your excess monthly cash it will take to reach that goal.

## How we built it
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
We built our application using react web framework and some essential web development languages such as html, css, and javascript. 

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first TAMUHack type of event, so we ran into challenges with starting a project like this from scratch and idea building. While coding we had trouble with positions the elements that we had thought through in a way befitting for our target audience.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we delivered a successful project within 24 hours. Our teamwork was much better than any of us could have expected and we were able to establish a great system of collaboration. We are also proud of what we were able to teach each other and learn in a short amount of time.

## What we learned
We learned how to development a web application using react, html and css. We each had different skills, so each of us had to learn something new such as utilizing GitHub, styling with css, and creating interactive elements with react.

## What's next for EZ Finance
